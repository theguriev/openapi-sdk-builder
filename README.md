# OpenAPI sdk builder ( Typescript ).

A way to quickly generate a client API. 

**Features**
* No need to write fetch functions yourself. 
* Automatic generation of true models. No need to deal with whateverStateFromJSON, whateverStateToJSON anymore.
* Lightweight client ( Just compare the two folders custom client and sdk ). 
* Full Typescript support. All hints will be available to you during the description of any fetch function.
